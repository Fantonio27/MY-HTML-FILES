	since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It 
	<font color="#93B5C6">has survived not only five centuries, </font>but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. 
	It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently 
	with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum

	<p><i><center>t is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at 
	its layout. <font color="red"><b>The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less</b> </font>normal distribution of letters, as opposed to 
	using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page 
	editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still 
	in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour 
	and the like)</center>.

	<div align = "right">Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 
	2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, 
	from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from s
	ections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the 
	theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.
